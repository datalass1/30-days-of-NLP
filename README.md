September 2021, 30 Days of NLP Learning and Code

## Key Notes
### Feature Engineering:
"Word2Vec uses a trick you may have seen elsewhere in machine learning. It trains a simple neural network with a single hidden layer to perform a certain task, but then does not actually use that neural network for the task it is trained on! Instead, the goal is actually just to learn the weights of the hidden layer. We’ll see that these weights are actually the “word vectors” that we’re trying to learn." http://mccormickml.com/2016/04/19/word2vec-tutorial-the-skip-gram-model/
